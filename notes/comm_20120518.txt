Opting-In for email signups. - We (ENG) can add opt-in for email anywhere the client would like.

Screen Name is not captured when a user create an account for the first time.

Instead the screen name is asked for when a user leaves a comment only.

If we capture the screen name then we need a way to push screen name back to the universal profile. Yes

Screen Name Rules - criteria for creating a name. Will be in final wires. (hand-off May 21, 2012)

Use Cases


1. No Sears account. No Communities account

0. User clicks on 'ask question', 'answer question', or 'comment'

If a new user (no sears or communities) click on ask a question and we prompt them to create an account then we should ask for screen name at the same time.

1.1 User creates an account via SSO
1.1.2 User Condition 20
	1.1.3.1 Error
	1.1.3.2 Continue with UCG

1.2 User creates an account via OpenID (Facebook)
1.2.2 Facebook Connect
1.2.3 Ask for screen name
1.2.4 Continue with UCG


2. Has Sears account. No Communities account

0. User clicks on 'ask question', 'answer question', or 'comment'

If someone has a sears account already, then the first time they login to communities through SSO, we check if they have a screen name. If they dont, we require the pick one.

2.1 User is Logged In 
2.1.1 User is identified via SSO Cookie
2.1.2 Ask for screen name
2.1.3 Continue with UCG


1. Existing Sears/Kmart (SSO) User - SIGNED IN
2. On communities page and about comment

Existing Sears/Kmart (SSO) User - NOT SIGNED IN


1. Users are on sears profile, the sign in. Simple
2. Users need to register for the first time.
3. Users already have a profile, but no screen name, so me make them pick one.



Kathryns Notes

Notes:

-Remove the Receive Communities Stuff check box and combine into the one check box. The eCommerce and community communication will be handled in one checkbox.

-Provide inline screen name experience for those who have not already created one. If we capture the screen name for the first time, we will push it back to the universal profile.

-Remove condition 30

-Page 3 Add all conditions from ratings and reviews for reference for engineering
